Whale Risk Index

Portfolio Project – Applied Risk Modeling & Data Integration (2015–2025)

The Whale Risk Index (WRI) is a data-driven risk modeling project designed to quantify and compare environmental risk exposure across marine regions between 2015 and 2025.

This project integrates heterogeneous real-world datasets — including shipping density, sea surface temperature anomalies, climate variability indicators, and whale mortality records — into a structured regional risk scoring framework.

While centered on marine ecosystems, the primary objective of this project is to demonstrate applied risk modeling, multi-source data integration, and analytical decision-support design.

Project Objective

To design and implement a scalable analytical framework that:

Aggregates cross-domain datasets into a unified structure

Engineers normalized risk variables

Constructs a composite regional risk index

Identifies high-risk zones and temporal trends

Translates complex environmental signals into structured risk metrics

Risk Modeling Framework

The Whale Risk Index calculates a composite regional risk score using weighted and normalized indicators, including:

Shipping traffic density

Sea surface temperature anomalies

Climate variability indices (e.g., ENSO-related patterns)

Historical mortality event frequency

Each variable is standardized to enable cross-regional comparison.
A weighted scoring methodology is applied to generate a comparative risk ranking.

This structure mirrors risk-scoring approaches commonly used in finance, logistics, insurance, and predictive analytics.

Data Sources (In Progress)

Whale mortality records (2015–2025)

Global shipping density datasets

Oceanographic temperature anomaly data

Climate index datasets

Data preprocessing includes cleaning, regional aggregation, normalization, and feature engineering.

Technical Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data cleaning & transformation pipelines

Feature engineering

Risk score computation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization tools (Matplotlib / Tableau / dashboard integration planned)

Current Project Status

In Active Development

Initial dataset structure established
Preliminary exploratory data analysis completed
Feature normalization and weighting refinement underway
Composite risk index calculation in progress
Visualization dashboard under development

Why This Project Matters

Although the dataset focuses on marine ecosystems, the analytical framework demonstrates transferable capabilities relevant to industry applications:

Multi-source data integration

Quantitative risk modeling

Composite scoring methodology

Cross-variable normalization

Analytical storytelling for decision support

This project serves as a structured demonstration of applied data science and risk analytics in real-world, multi-variable environments.
